# KerbalPlanetCards
A texture pack mod for Balatro that retextures the planet cards + related sprites with planets from Kerbal Space Program
Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)
The "KerbalPlanetCards" folder is not the mod folder, it contains all of the individual texture packs. The folders inside are the actual mods, as each individual pack is for a different theme (currently just Stock KSP1 - more to be added)
