# KerbalPlanetCards
A set of texture packs for Balatro that retexture the planet cards + related sprites with the planets from Kerbal Space Program

Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

The "KerbalPlanetCards-main" folder is not the mod folder, it contains all of the individual texture packs. These folders are the actual mods, as each individual pack is for a different theme
