# KerbalPlanetCards
A set of texture packs for Balatro that retexture the planet cards + related sprites with the planets from Kerbal Space Program

Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

The "KerbalPlanetCards-main" folder is not the mod folder, it contains all of the individual texture packs. These folders inside are the actual mods, as each individual pack is for a different theme

Currently, the two packs I have finished are Stock KSP1 and Outer Planets Mod + Minor Planets Expansion (more to be added)
